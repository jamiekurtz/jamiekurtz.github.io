Software development is hard. And while agile methods can certainly deliver faster and cheaper and with higher quality, they can also more quickly spin out of control and create lots of wasted time and energy and increased frustration.

This post will be a brief guided tour through ten easy-to-implement tips for reducing chaos, increasing efficiency, and helping your agile development teams run leaner and cleaner - and happier. These aren't in any particular order. And they are based on my own experience over the last couple decades. No doubt other people will have differing opinions, which is great, and I would love to hear them. This is simply what I've found to work well in a practical way across many types of software projects and many types of teams.

<br />

#### 1. Utilize no-interpretation-needed severities in your bug tracker

First, **use a Severity field that is separate from Priority**. It's a fundamental fact of building software that an issue's severity in the eyes of a __user__ is distinct from priority in the eyes of the __business__ - or software provider. Priority should take into account all kinds of software-building things, like budget, stakeholder preference, release timing, market opportunities, and available skillset and tooling. This also implies that Priority can change over time for a given issue. And it often does!

But a changing priority value should absolutely **not** change the severity of the issue as seen by the user at the time it was reported. So make sure you issue tracker has both fields - Severity and Priority.

And second... stop using severity values like {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} or {Hi, Med, Low}. These are way too subjective and arbitrary. The development teams hardly ever know what these mean, and the poor users don't stand a chance. Here's what I recommend, which has worked well for me over the years:

    0 - Blocked
    1 - Crash, hang, data loss, security issue
    2 - Severe loss of functionality
    3 - Usability issue, functionality doesnâ€™t match spec
    4 - Suggestion

I haven't found many issues that can't be placed into one of those severity levels. And again, these don't indicate business priority - but rather the importance of the issue from the user's perspective.

When entering these values into your issue tracker, just put the whole text in there... i.e. "0 - Blocked". No need to just put the numbers, and then make people try to figure out what the heck the "0" or the "3" actually mean. Trust me, put the whole darn thing in the list of Severity choices.

It's been amazing to me to watch the clarity this small change introduces to a development team. There's no guessing as to the nature of what user/tester found! 

These levels come courtesy years ago from one of the best team leads I've ever worked with - [Kevin Kelly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kkelly18).

#### 2. Great Hardware for Your Developers and Testers

I'm continually astounded by the massive cost in time/billable-hours companies incur for something as trivial as a second or third monitor. You can just about make up the cost of a monitor in single day! 

I remember when 2nd monitors were just becoming popular, and I bought everyone on my team a second monitor to plug into their laptop. It cost me all of about $2000 total, and gained me something in the neighborhood of 30% increase in productiviy. Not to mention developer happiness. And, in this particular case, envy from developers on other teams in the company:)

Seriously, there's more than you think riding on a developer's ability to go fast and free. Freedom almost always wins!! And things like: good monitors, good keyboards, lots of RAM, plenty of CPU horsepower, and extra hardware lying around go **A LONG WAY** in offering freedom, increasing productivty, and overall keeping your top talent around a little longer.

The math is drop dead simple to do (e.g. $200 monitor to "buy back" an hour or two a day is a no brainer). Developer and tester happiness is a little harder to measure, but you can just ask, and watch, and listen. You claim to an agile shop - so try something new in the way of hardware, get some feedback, and adjust. These days, hardware is cheap, and people are expensive. And turnover is VERY expensive. So remember that the next time you're cringing at a mere $200 to double someone's RAM. 

If you don't believe me, try buying a nice keyboard for everyone on your team. I've been very happy with the [Model S Ultimate from daskeyboard](http://www.daskeyboard.com/model-s-ultimate/). It really does make you learn to type faster. Or the relatively new one from Jeff Atwood - approproiately named the [Code Keyboard](https://codekeyboards.com/). Sure, they are in the range of $150. But trust me, buy a few, see what happens. 

#### 3. Healthy Team Role Ratio

This is another one of those "try it and adjust" things. But don't sell yourself short before giving it a chance. 

Here's what I'm talking about... try a ratio of developers to testers to analysts like this:

    3 Developers
    2 Testers
    1 Business analyst

In short, a dev/test/ba ration of 3/2/1. 

Yes, I know there are other ways to carve up a team. But in my experience, the typical risk and subsequent tragedy is that we create teams that are more like: 10 developers, 1 tester (or, sometimes, no testers), and maybe a half-time analyst. Instead of that insanity, start with a 3/2/1 ratio, run it for a while, and adjust based on velocity and feedback and outcome.

If you find yourself already in a situation where the ratio isn't even close to 3/2/1, I strongly encourage you to adjust - somehow. Maybe that means **giving up** some developers in return for some more testers. Crazy, I know!! But when the ratio is off, bad things happen. So the goal is to **fix the ratio** - not just pile on more developers.

The thinking that more developers means more better output is just foolish. It is the __team__ that delivers, the __team__ that has velocity, the __team's__ collective ability that releases software - NOT JUST DEVELOPERS. Fix the ratio, and you'll deliver more and deliver better and with less stress.

Someone once told me that too many developers without enough analysts means the developers just make crap up to build. That's not good, as it's wasted time and money and increases frustration. Not enough testers means that **your users** find the bugs - instead of you. To say it another way, developers will undoubtedly create bugs. So the question isn't "how many bugs are there?", the question is "who's going to find them?!?!". A healthy ratio helps ensure that your own team finds the bugs - not the users. And of course too many analysts and not enough developers results in wasted time and wasted specs for features that never make it into the product. Essentially, the backlog gets longer and longer, and people just give up on ever seeing their "thing" make it into the product.

"3/2/1" - that's the ratio to aim for. Try it, and adjust for maximum **team** quality and velocity. 

#### 4. Wednesday to Wednesday Iterations

These days many (if not "most") development teams are utilizing some form of iterations or sprints to manage their work stream. This generally means you agree to start on day X, and end on day Y. For some reason it seems like the natural inclination is to start on a Monday and end on Friday. But for a few reasons, this is less than optimal, and can be downright maddening.

When you end on a Friday, everyone pretty much works under the assumption that they really have the weekend to finish. So Friday usually slides into Monday. And for good reason. Why would you give a team only 5 days to do some amount of work when you can instead give them 7 (or, 12 instead of 14, etc.). 

Further, those personal days and short vacations usually include Fridays and Mondays, so the chances of missing people are quite a bit higher if you start and/or stop on Mondays and Fridays.

Then there's the typical human emotional baggage of Mondays and Fridays. Mondays kind of suck, and by Friday afternoon most people (at least, the hardest working and most efficient ones) are pretty well ready to be done. So forcing some big demo/wrap-up meeting every Friday from 2 to 5 is pretty pointless. Especially when you've got out-of-town consultants on board, as they are typically headed home by Friday afternoon. You'll do your team a favor by giving back their Monday mornings and Friday afternoons.

If you currently run your sprints/iterations Monday to Friday, try switching to starting and ending on a Wednesday. I'm confident you'll find that the team is more likley to be fully engaged, and with weekends in there they might even get more done from time to time.

#### 5. Implement Continuous Delivery First

Hands down, the most effective way to really supercharge your development team is to ensure that they are receiving feedback early and often. This means the software is available for testing and general use early and often. This means, then, that the build-test-package-deployment process MUST be automated, or else some poor schmuck will end up spending all of his time manually preparing for and deploying "builds" (and, typically, screwing them up). 

If those frequent "builds" and deployments aren't happening, then your team is - quite simply - wandering around in the dark guessing at what work needs to be done next. 

The agile way of building software requires feedback. There's no way around it. One of my co-workers once said "constant feedback is baked into the agile way of creating software". I agree wholeheartedly. So much so that I tell people "if you aren't doing Continuous Delivery, then you aren't agile". Period. 

To be fair, you can't just "turn on" [continuous delivery](http://continuousdelivery.com/) (CD). It does take some skill and experience. So maybe this particular trick isn't easy. **But you can** bring on a consultant that will make it easy. It generally doesn't take a ton of time for an engineer experienced in the ways of CD to right the ship. So if this is a new concept to you, reach out to me at [Fusion Alliance](http://www.fusionalliance.com). Either myself or a number of others would be happy to take a few weeks to turn on CD, and help your team realize the full potential of agile.
