- title: "ASP.NET MVC 4 and the Web API: Building a REST Service from Start to Finish"

  description: If you’re new to the REST architecture and/or new to ASP.NET Web API, this book will help you learn both in a short amount of time. I take you quickly through the basics of HTTP REST, some of the more prominent features in Web API, setting up a simple Web API solution in Visual Studio, and securing the service – all within just a little over 100 pages.

- title: Pro Drupal as an Enterprise Development Platform

  description: "Are you a developer or IT manager that has ever thought there has to be a better/faster/cheaper way? Rather than continuing to write the same code and components over and over, this book can help you start with a solid, “mostly-there” platform, allowing you to focus on filling the business-specific gaps that actually change from project to project. "

- title: "ASP.NET Web API 2: Building a REST Service from Start to Finish"
  date: July 2014
  url: "http://www.amazon.com/ASP-NET-Web-API-Building-Service/dp/1484201108"
  pic: webapi2-thumb
  description: "Following on the heels of my first MVC/WebAPI book, Brian Wortman and I set out to address some of the concerns and feedback I received with regards to a lack of focus on the underlying Web API framework. This new edition focuses more on the Web API, includes more content related to testing, and a working Single Page Application web site that uses the REST service built throughout the book. We think you’ll find this book filled with lots more information, with a big increase in focus."
