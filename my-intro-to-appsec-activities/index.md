*(this page is the maintained/living list started from the [My Intro to AppSec](/2014/07/15/my-intro-to-application-security/) blog post; feel free to post comments there)*

**Read (and do) Georgia Weidman&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Penetration-Testing-Hands--Introduction-Hacking/dp/1593275641" target="_blank">Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking</a> book** &#8211; learn the basics of pentesting to better understand what &#8220;the other side&#8221; is doing against our applications and their underlying infrastructure; basic techniques with nmap, metasploit, and other such tools

**Read Gary McGraw&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Security-Building-Gary-McGraw/dp/0321356705" target="_blank">Software Security</a> book** &#8211; learn from one of the best in the industry about software security, secure development processes, security-minded design and architecture, and much more; all centered on security best practices for the applications we design and build

**Learn (and memorize) the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10" target="_blank">OWASP Top 10</a>** &#8211; these are the top security-related risks to today&#8217;s web applications; I believe every web developer should be at least somewhat aware of the items in this list

**Be able to exploit each of the&nbsp;OWASP Top 10**&nbsp;- know how to attack a web site according to each of the top 10; it would seem understanding the mechanics of attack for these vulnerabilities would help prevent them during application design and build; utilize sites and tutorials such as&nbsp;https://www.hackthissite.org to facilitate experimentation

**Proficiency with my <a href="https://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple" target="_blank">WiFi Pineapple</a>** &#8211; with so many connected systems these days, including mobile apps talking to backend services, I want to better understand how these types of communication channels can be exploited; what better way than to practice exploiting them myself!

**Learn the highlights of the main InfoSec policies/frameworks** &#8211; I want to understand the various policies, laws, and frameworks in place meant to protect users of the systems I design/build/maintain; this might include: PCI/DSS, HIPAA, PII, BSIMM.com, and Microsoft&#8217;s SDL

**Gain comfort with network security** &#8211; with nearly my entire career being spent on the software development side of systems, I don&#8217;t have any exposure to routers, firewalls, load balancers, WiFi&#8230; any of that; while I don&#8217;t intend to become a full network engineer, I would like to have some level of comfort with the basic systems, devices, commands, and practices related to networking and network security; might include material and exams such as Network+, Security+, and SSCP

**Data storage security** &#8211; nearly all applications deal with stored data, much of which needs to be stored in a secure manner. This particular area is to help me understand the various aspects of data encryption and how to best implement it, including tools such as [Transparent Data Encryption](https://www.simple-talk.com/sql/database-administration/transparent-data-encryption/).

**Overview of encryption / cryptography** &#8211; once again, with so many connected systems (i.e. the &#8220;internet of things&#8221;), I believe having a baseline understanding of how data is securely transported and stored is an important aspect in designing and building secure applications; I might even enjoy the classes and research required to obtain a Masters in cryptography; but for now, some overview material would go a long way&#8230; like these:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cryptography-Dummies-Chey-Cobb/dp/0764541889" target="_blank">Cryptography for Dummies</a>&nbsp;book and a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto" target="_blank">college-level course on cryptography</a>
