Is it possible to apply <a href="http://continuousdelivery.com/" target="_blank">continuous delivery</a> techniques, borrowed from building and shipping software within an agile environment, to the process of book publishing? And get paid? And&#8230; get support from the major publishers in the technical book market?

To take a step back&#8230; like many of you, I&#8217;ve been building and shipping software for quite a few years more than a decade. And the latter half of those efforts took place within the context of agile or near-agile projects and environments. Even to the point of **shipping** the agile-way &#8211; i.e. continuous delivery. As such, I&#8217;ve grown quite accustomed to thinking and working under the mindset that I don&#8217;t have to actually get ALL of a product or application completed in order to ship version 1.0. In fact, it&#8217;s become quite important to just ship only those features and/or bug fixes that users need to start using the product. And nothing more. Many people refer to this as a <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/minimum-viable-product.html" target="_blank">minimum viable product</a> (MVP). If you haven&#8217;t tried this approach, I highly recommend it!

Stepping forward&#8230; I recently completed and published my first &#8220;real&#8221; book - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Using-ASP-NET-Web-API-MVC/dp/1430249773" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC 4 and the Web API: Building a REST Service from Start to Finish</a>.

Given my preferred software development practices of continuous delivery and MVP, I found it all-too-natural to think along those same lines while writing the book. To just assume that I could fix any &#8220;bug&#8221; after the book was published was a very natural, if not totally subconscious, assumption.

Problem is, once a book is published&#8230; it&#8217;s gone! And other than errata and out-of-band blog posts and Twitter tweets, there&#8217;s not much I can do now to fix &#8220;bugs&#8221;. Had I fully realized that 6 months ago, I would have likely spent some more time testing and reworking much of the book. Sure, maybe I *should* have just know better. Regardless, there&#8217;s a not so insignificant portion of the book that has &#8220;bugs&#8221;.** If you read some of the earlier reviews on the book&#8217;s Amazon page, you can see them**. And for the most part, I agree with them! That is, they are real &#8220;bugs&#8221; in the book that need to be fixed &#8211; which should, in software parlance, trigger a new build and deployment&#8230; thus offering an updated &#8220;build&#8221; of the book to its readers.

But alas, I can&#8217;t do that. Sure, I can release a 2nd edition. And I&#8217;m hoping to within the next three to six months. However, a 2nd release is markedly different than many releases that are mere days or even hours apart, each one fixing a small set of bugs.

And so, I&#8217;m both a little frustrated and a lot disappointed; in myself, and in the book publishing industry at large. Even eBooks don&#8217;t offer a platform for continuous delivery. They&#8217;re still only released once &#8211; with maybe an optional 2nd edition. But for me, that simply doesn&#8217;t cut it. Readers deserve better, just like users of iPhone apps and browser-based email applications. I suppose I could deliver my next book fully online, and charge for access. But how would it receive major mainstream promotion? And how would it ever show up on Amazon or Safari Books Online? There-in lies my problem. I would absolutely LOVE to publish online, allowing for continuous delivery of &#8220;bug&#8221; fixes and new &#8220;features&#8221; in the book.

Maybe some day.
