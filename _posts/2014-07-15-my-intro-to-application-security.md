The information below serves as a list of education-related activities for me to follow as I slowly make my way into the deep dark world of Application Security (appsec).

As referenced on my [about][1] page, I&#8217;ve been doing Microsoft-based development and architecture for a number of years, somewhat recently branching out into things like PHP, Drupal, and NodeJS. In order to improve upon my development skills with respect to application security, I&#8217;ve decided to dabble with things like pentesting, networking and network security certifications, web application vulnerabilities, OWASP, and cryptography.&nbsp;

People spend a lifetime learning about and working in this field (sometimes more broadly referred to as InfoSec).&nbsp;For now, I am merely looking for a survey of sorts; passing over many appsec-related topics briefly, in order to better understand the types of security risks associated with the applications I design, build, and maintain. (I also enjoy working on Linux, and security is a great avenue for improving one&#8217;s Linux skills!) The list below reflects this survey approach, and is not intended to represent an in-depth training regimen fit for a full-time InfoSec professional. Note that parts of this list are taken from a <a href="http://learning.criticalwatch.com/newbie" target="_blank">similar (and, lengthier) list</a> created by Jesper Jercenoks, <a dir="ltr" href="https://twitter.com/jesperjurcenoks" data-send-impression-cookie="true">@jesperjurcenoks&nbsp;</a>,&nbsp;at <a href="http://www.criticalwatch.com/" target="_blank">Critical Watch</a>.&nbsp;

If you have experience with learning application security, especially from a developer&#8217;s point of view, I would love to hear it. Please feel free to post a comment below. I&#8217;m going to keep this list as a[ separate page on my site][2], and would like to keep it as relevant and useful to myself and others as possible.

**Read (and do) Georgia Weidman&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Penetration-Testing-Hands--Introduction-Hacking/dp/1593275641" target="_blank">Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking</a> book** &#8211; learn the basics of pentesting to better understand what &#8220;the other side&#8221; is doing against our applications and their underlying infrastructure; basic techniques with nmap, metasploit, and other such tools

**Read Gary McGraw&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Software-Security-Building-Gary-McGraw/dp/0321356705" target="_blank">Software Security</a> book** &#8211; learn from one of the best in the industry about software security, secure development processes, security-minded design and architecture, and much more; all centered on security best practices for the applications we design and build

**Learn (and memorize) the <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10" target="_blank">OWASP Top 10</a>** &#8211; these are the top security-related risks to today&#8217;s web applications; I believe every web developer should be at least somewhat aware of the items in this list

**Be able to exploit each of the&nbsp;OWASP Top 10**&nbsp;- know how to attack a web site according to each of the top 10; it would seem understanding the mechanics of attack for these vulnerabilities would help prevent them during application design and build; utilize sites and tutorials such as&nbsp;https://www.hackthissite.org to facilitate experimentation

**Proficiency with my <a href="https://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple" target="_blank">WiFi Pineapple</a>** &#8211; with so many connected systems these days, including mobile apps talking to backend services, I want to better understand how these types of communication channels can be exploited; what better way than to practice exploiting them myself!

**Learn the highlights of the main InfoSec policies/frameworks** &#8211; I want to understand the various policies, laws, and frameworks in place meant to protect users of the systems I design/build/maintain; this might include: PCI/DSS, HIPAA, PII, BSIMM.com, and Microsoft&#8217;s SDL

**Gain comfort with network security** &#8211; with nearly my entire career being spent on the software development side of systems, I don&#8217;t have any exposure to routers, firewalls, load balancers, WiFi&#8230; any of that; while I don&#8217;t intend to become a full network engineer, I would like to have some level of comfort with the basic systems, devices, commands, and practices related to networking and network security; might include material and exams such as Network+, Security+, and SSCP

**Overview of encryption / cryptography** &#8211; once again, with so many connected systems (i.e. the &#8220;internet of things&#8221;), I believe having a baseline understanding of how data is securely transported and stored is an important aspect in designing and building secure applications; I might even enjoy the classes and research required to obtain a Masters in cryptography; but for now, some overview material would go a long way&#8230; like these:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cryptography-Dummies-Chey-Cobb/dp/0764541889" target="_blank">Cryptography for Dummies</a>&nbsp;book and a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto" target="_blank">college-level course on cryptography</a>
