The other day, I found myself trying to think of a name for an interface I was building. I knew I was building a <a href="http://www.dofactory.com/Patterns/PatternStrategy.aspx" target="_blank">strategy</a>, but sometimes I have a hard time coming up with something other than “XyzManager”. So I decided to list out as many types of strategies as I could find or think of. I’ve since used this list to help me name other strategies – i.e. get more crisp and accurate with names of interfaces. I hope this helps you, too.

Feel free to suggest more types!
