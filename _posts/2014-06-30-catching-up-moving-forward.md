Every now and then, I like to pause and take stock of where I&#8217;ve been, what I&#8217;ve learned, and think about the nature of what I want to discover next. This short post reflects such a pause.

<img class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-283" alt="drupal-front-cover" src="/img/uploads/2013/12/drupal-front-cover-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" />&nbsp;First and foremost, I had the pleasure of working with Thomas Besluau this past year to write&nbsp;[&#8220;Drupal as an Enterprise Development Platform][1].&#8221; We had a blast as we set out to prove that you could use Drupal to build enterprise-class web sites and services, including all the typical enterprise-y concerns found in most line of business applications; and do so without having to write hardly any code. I feel like we succeeded!

At Fusion Alliance, we&#8217;ve been leveraging the power and extensibility of Drupal, as detailed in our book, to quickly build business-oriented web sites and mobile backend services with hardly any custom code. Think of it as using a set of Nuget packages or Ruby gems &#8211; except that you don&#8217;t have to write the hundreds/thousands of lines of code to use the libraries, and you don&#8217;t have to create all of the corresponding UI screens/pages. You just turn them on! The approach of using a higher-than-code level of abstraction to build systems is very appropriate for a wide array of use cases&#8230;probably more than we developers would care to admit <img src="http://www.jamiekurtz.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> 

I had so much fun writing the Drupal book, I decided to start another one. This time, Brian Wortman and I joined forces to create a 2nd edition of [my previous REST / Web API book][2]. One reason for writing this 2nd edition was to cover all the great new features and capabilities included
<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-346" alt="9781484201107HiRes" src="/img/uploads/2014/06/9781484201107HiRes-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /> in the 2nd release of Microsoft&#8217;s ASP.NET Web API; features that we feel make the Web API that much more useful for building RESTful services in .NET. Mainly though, I received a lot of great feedback and suggestions about my first book, and really wanted the chance to integrate those suggestions and improve on the book&#8217;s overall story. As I talked about in a [previous post][4], I truly believe in the feedback loop of the agile development process. Taking my first book&#8217;s feedback and releasing a &#8220;version 2&#8243; of the book was a very a natural outcome of that belief. Thanks to all who commented on Amazon and/or emailed me directly. That feedback greatly shaped the [2nd edition][3]!

Somewhere in there, a couple other guys and I started building a new product. It was really born out of a need we share; which is to be able to quickly and easily capture information. There are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of note-taking and task-tracking apps out there. But we feel like none of them provide the super-low-barrier approach to capturing ideas and thoughts that we really want. So we decided to do the thing most developers do quite naturally: write our own! The entire product consists of a web site, Android and iOS apps, and some desktop widgets. We&#8217;re approaching what we might call an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) release, hoping to complete it later this summer or early fall. More details will follow soon. I&#8217;d love to get a few people signed up for a BETA release and some early feedback!

I found an online JWT builder, but it&#8217;s a little clunky and hard to understand. And since I&#8217;m always looking for easy narrowly focused applications to write, (and I really wanted to practice my NodeJS/Single-Page-Application skills), I decided to whip one up over a weekend. So if you ever find yourself in need of a test JSON Web Token, please check out <http://jwtbuilder.jamiekurtz.com>. It&#8217;s very easy to use, and might actually teach you a bit about JSON Web Tokens <img src="http://www.jamiekurtz.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

Alongside writing a couple of new books and working towards a product launch, I decided to pursue a career-long passion of mine: software security. The domain of software security is massive, but it&#8217;s incredibly interesting to me. I thoroughly enjoy learning about application security, information security, and the art and science of penetration testing. I&#8217;ve spent almost 20 years building software, but the architectural aspects of security have always eluded me. Well, no more! I&#8217;ve begun what I feel is a new adventure in my passion of building quality software, where my goal is to truly understand those dark and scary corners of development known as AppSec. I&#8217;m super excited, and would love to get to the point where I can write a book or two on the topic.

So for the next couple of years, I&#8217;ll be focusing my professional attention on two main things: 1) launching and growing a new product, and 2) trying to weasel my way into the world of application security. Who knows, maybe there&#8217;s another book or two in the cards. There&#8217;s just too much exciting stuff to learn about and share with others &#8211; I can&#8217;t keep it all to myself!

Any advice for me as I delve into the world of software security? Feel free to share! ([@jesperjurcenoks&nbsp;][6]at [Critical Watch][7]&nbsp;has a great post on getting started:[&nbsp;http://learning.criticalwatch.com/newbie/][8]; would love to see more like this)
