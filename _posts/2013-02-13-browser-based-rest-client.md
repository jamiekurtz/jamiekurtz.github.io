I&#8217;m not much of a product or tool pusher. But, given that I&#8217;ve been working on REST services a lot lately, and doing so much of the time on <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint</a> (where <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/" target="_blank">Fiddler</a> isn&#8217;t supported without a fair amount of jerking around), I found the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CEYQFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fchrome.google.com%2Fwebstore%2Fdetail%2Fadvanced-rest-client%2Fhgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo%3Fhl%3Den-US&ei=8VwcUb6UDK670QHUjoDgBA&usg=AFQjCNEkroM42vfwzL0_5_3WgPLuFCnAZg&sig2=7yZxjA4JogfCTLZ0Fwfxig&bvm=bv.42452523,d.dmQ" target="_blank">Advanced REST Client for Chrome</a> extension to be incredibly valuable. Priceless!

It supports any HTTP method, HTTP headers, raw or formatted payload, and even content-type options. It can also save your URLs, making repeated testing a snap on a target development or test server.

Check it out!!
